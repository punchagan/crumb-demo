Welcome to the demo site of Crumb, a GitHub issue based commenting system.

You should be able to view the comments below without authentication, until you
are rate-limited by GitHub for too many unauthenticated API requests.  When
that happens, click the weird looking button in the comments section to
authenticate.

This is just an experimental hack, that I worked on as an interesting thing to
build a "prototype" for.  Use it on real websites at your own risk!
